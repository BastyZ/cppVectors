# cppVectors
First homework of GPU computing course at fcfm, it's like a fast tutorial/training on c++

__c++17__ is used for this project.

## Running the homework: 
bc idk how to run cpp code from a terminal, I'll recomend to open the project on CLion and run it from there.
I'm hope that in a short future I'll know more details, but it's my first time with cpp and CLion made it a lot easier 
on Linux.

## Comments
Tests run as a function on the main, anyway, in a future will be good to store it on a place where
a CI app were capable to run them. In the meantime, enjoy all the assert functions side-by-side.

Templates are used as requested, idk if it's a good practice or not, so if you know a syntax checker or a
guide/documentation plase tell me.
